By working here, freelancers receive their full agreed-upon contract amount directly into their private wallets, with no platform-side earnings deductions, because clients pay the flat 5% platform fee.</p><h2>1. Lightning Network Integration (LND, CLN, LDK)</h2><p>Companies are looking for developers who can integrate Layer-2 solutions into their existing checkouts. Expertise in LND, Core Lightning (CLN), and LDK is highly prized.</p><h2>2. Non-Custodial Wallet Design</h2><p>Creating intuitive, secure UI/UX for self-custodial Bitcoin applications requires specific design skills. Seamlessly guiding users through seed phrase backups and channel management is a critical niche.</p><h2>3. Nostr and Fedimint App Development</h2><p>With decentralized social protocols like Nostr and community mints like Fedimint growing rapidly, engineers who understand decentralized relays and chaumian e-cash are in huge demand.</p><h2>4. Cryptographic Smart Escrow Integration</h2><p>Securing contracts with smart escrow systems is a core requirement of modern peer-to-peer commerce. BitLance uses these principles natively to lock funds securely before milestones begin.</p><h2>5. Technical Content & Educational Writing</h2><p>Explaining complex technical protocols clearly is a premium skill. Companies need writers to draft documentation, tutorials, and support guides that build trust and drive user adoption.</p><p>Getting started on BitLance is simple: no invasive KYC forms are required—only your name and email address are needed to build a profile and start bidding on jobs today.</p>",

Denominating contract rates in sats ensures that you receive borderless, hard currency directly on-chain or over the Lightning Network.</p><h2>1. Establishing Your Base Rate</h2><p>Begin by defining your target hourly rate in fiat, then convert that into sats using dynamic conversion tools. It is recommended to include a tiny volatility buffer when pitching on longer contracts.</p><h2>2. Milestone-Based Escrows Protect Your Rate</h2><p>On BitLance, clients fund contracts per milestone using Lightning invoices in their Messages section. This locks the negotiated budget in escrow before you write a single line of code, protecting your time from payment defaults.</p><h2>3. Direct Lightning Payouts</h2><p>The moment a client clicks 'Approve and Pay' on your milestone, the escrow is automatically released. The sats flow directly to the Lightning payout address configured in your Settings—bypassing any intermediate holding accounts or withdraw fees.</p>",

BitLance leverages the Lightning Network for all platform transactions to enable micro-payroll and friction-free payouts.</p><h2>1. Base Layer On-Chain Transactions</h2><p>On-chain transactions are written permanently to the Bitcoin blockchain. They are ideal for storing large sums of wealth but are accompanied by longer block verification times and higher miner fees.</p><h2>2. Lightning Network (Layer-2) Invoices</h2><p>The Lightning Network operates as a second layer, allowing users to send near-instant transactions with fees of just a few sats. It is perfect for micro-payroll. On BitLance, when a client accepts a proposal, they fund the contract's escrow by generating and paying a Lightning invoice right inside the chat.</p><h2>3. Direct Non-Custodial Release</h2><p>When the client is satisfied with the work, clicking 'Approve and Pay' triggers an automated protocol release. The sats land directly in your preferred self-custodial Lightning address, ensuring you maintain 100% control of your hard-earned funds.</p>",
